# SQL Database / Company data storing and querying

## By Erick Hernandez

In this project I had to create a database using Postgresql which contained several fields for an employee record.

The process involved:
1. Data identification and analysis
2. Classification into tables regarding the nature of the records.
3. Creation of Primary Keys in order to vinculate the tables between them.
4. Querying to insure data integrity and performing of desired data.
5. Visualization with https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ for final recognition.
